# Forgot Password Schema Documentation

## Overview

The `forgotPasswordSchema` is designed to handle the password reset process by storing the email, token, and creation time of OTP (One-Time Password) requests. This schema ensures that OTPs are valid only for a short period, enhancing security.

## Schema Definition

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const forgotPasswordSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  email: String,
  token: String,
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now, expires: 90 }, // OTP expires after 90 seconds
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('OTP', forgotPasswordSchema);
```
````

### Fields

- `email`: The email address associated with the password reset request. This field is of type `String` and stores the user's email.
- `token`: The token generated for the password reset process. This field is of type `String` and stores the OTP.
- `createdAt`: The timestamp when the OTP was created. This field is of type `Date`, defaults to the current date and time, and includes an expiration setting that automatically deletes the document 90 seconds after creation.

### Field Details

- **email**:
  - Type: `String`
  - Description: Stores the email address of the user requesting a password reset.
- **token**:
  - Type: `String`
  - Description: Stores the unique OTP token used for verifying the password reset request.
- **createdAt**:
  - Type: `Date`
  - Default: `Date.now`
  - Expires: 90 seconds
  - Description: Stores the creation time of the OTP. The document automatically expires and is removed from the database 90 seconds after creation to ensure the token is used within a short time frame.

### Expiration

- The `createdAt` field has an expiration setting of 90 seconds. This means that 90 seconds after the document is created, it will be automatically deleted from the database. This ensures that the OTP is only valid for a short period, enhancing the security of the password reset process.

### Security Considerations

- **Expiration**: The expiration time of 90 seconds ensures that the OTP is only valid for a short period, reducing the risk of misuse.
- **Token Generation**: Ensure that the token is generated using a secure method to prevent predictable OTPs.

---

This schema effectively handles the password reset process by providing a secure, time-limited OTP mechanism. The expiration setting on the `createdAt` field ensures that tokens are only valid for a short duration, enhancing the overall security of the system.
