# Ensuring Accessibility in our Frontend Development

Ensuring accessibility in our frontend applications is a priority to provide an inclusive experience for all users, including those with disabilities. By incorporating accessibility best practices, we make our application more usable and accessible to a broader audience. Here are some ways we achieve this:

## Semantic HTML

Using semantic HTML elements helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the structure of the content. For example, in the `PageNotFound` component, we use `<Typography>` components with appropriate variants to convey the hierarchy of headings and text.

```jsx
<Typography variant="h3" component="h1" gutterBottom>
  404 - Page Not Found
</Typography>
<Typography variant="h6" component="p" gutterBottom>
  Oops! Looks like this page is as lost as an unfiled invoice.
</Typography>
```
````

## ARIA Attributes

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes provide additional information to assistive technologies. In the `Snackbar` component, we use the `aria-label` attribute to improve the accessibility of the close button.

```jsx
<IconButton
  key="close"
  aria-label="Close"
  color="inherit"
  onClick={handleClose}
>
  <CloseIcon style={{ color: '#fff' }} />
</IconButton>
```

## Keyboard Navigation

Ensuring that all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard is crucial. For instance, the custom button component `CustomPrimaryButton` can be focused and activated using the keyboard.

```jsx
<Button
  variant="contained"
  sx={{
    bgcolor: bgcolour,
    color: `${bgcolour === '#ffffff' ? '#000' : '#fff'}`,
    textTransform: 'none',
    fontSize: '15px',
    fontWeight: 500,
    width: '100%',
    height: '40px',
    '&:hover': {
      bgcolor: darken(bgcolour, 0.2),
    },
    '&:disabled': {
      color: '#666',
    },
  }}
  disabled={disabled}
  onClick={onClick}
  data-testid={dataTestid || ''}
>
  {label}
</Button>
```

## Focus Management

Managing focus appropriately ensures that users navigating via keyboard or screen readers do not get lost. For example, after the `PageNotFound` component redirects to the home page, setting focus to the main content area ensures a smooth transition.

## Visual Indicators

Providing clear visual indicators for interactive elements helps users understand what actions they can take. The `CustomPrimaryButton` component changes color on hover and has a distinct style when disabled.

```jsx
sx={{
  '&:hover': {
    bgcolor: darken(bgcolour, 0.2),
  },
  '&:disabled': {
    color: '#666',
  },
}}
```

## Responsive Design

Creating responsive designs ensures that the application is accessible on various devices and screen sizes. For example, the `InfoCards` component adjusts its layout based on the screen size.

```jsx
const isSmallScreen = useMediaQuery('(max-width: 1200px)');

return (
  <motion.div
    style={{ padding: '0 5%', marginBottom: isSmallScreen ? '90px' : '' }}
  >
    {/* ... */}
  </motion.div>
);
```

## Providing Feedback

Providing feedback through accessible components like `Snackbar` ensures that all users receive important information. The `Snackbar` component in our code uses clear icons and text to convey success or error messages.

```jsx
const getIcon = (bgColor2) => {
  switch (bgColor2) {
    case 'tomato':
      return <ErrorIcon style={{ marginRight: 8, color: '#fff' }} />;
    case 'green':
      return <CheckCircleIcon style={{ marginRight: 8, color: '#fff' }} />;
    default:
      return <HelpIcon style={{ marginRight: 8, color: '#fff' }} />;
  }
};
```

## Color Contrast

Ensuring sufficient color contrast between text and background improves readability for users with visual impairments. In the `CustomPrimaryButton` component, we ensure that the text color contrasts well with the button's background color.

```jsx
sx={{
  bgcolor: bgcolour,
  color: `${bgcolour === '#ffffff' ? '#000' : '#fff'}`,
}}
```

## Skip Navigation Links

Adding skip navigation links allows users to bypass repetitive content and navigate directly to the main content. This is particularly useful for screen reader users and keyboard navigators.

## Alt Text for Images

Providing descriptive alt text for images ensures that users who cannot see the images still understand their context and purpose. In the `InfoCards` component, alt text can be added to images to describe their content.

## Descriptive Link Text

Using descriptive link text helps users understand the destination or action of a link. Avoiding vague text like "click here" improves accessibility for screen reader users.

## Accessible Forms

Ensuring that form controls have associated labels helps users understand the purpose of each input field. Using `label` elements and associating them with form controls via the `for` attribute or `aria-label` ensures clarity.

## Error Identification and Suggestions

Providing clear error messages and suggestions for fixing input errors helps users correct mistakes efficiently. This can be done using ARIA live regions to announce errors or using visual indicators.

## Consistent Navigation

Maintaining consistent navigation patterns across the application helps users learn and predict how to navigate the app. This reduces cognitive load and improves the overall user experience.

## Accessible Animations

Ensuring that animations do not cause seizures or discomfort is important. Using the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query, we can adjust or disable animations for users who prefer reduced motion.

```jsx
const prefersReducedMotion = useMediaQuery('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)');

return (
  <motion.div
    initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
    animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
    transition={{ duration: prefersReducedMotion ? 0 : 1 }}
  >
    {/* ... */}
  </motion.div>
);
```

By integrating these practices into our development process, we ensure that our frontend applications are accessible and provide a positive experience for all users.
