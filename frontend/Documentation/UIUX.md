## Introduction

Welcome to the UI/UX design documentation for the E-Invoicing Application for SMEs. This project aims to support SMEs in supply-chain relationships by providing a seamless e-invoicing solution that adheres to Industry 4.0 principles and UBL 2.1 XML standards, ensuring compliance with Australian and New Zealand specifications.

## Design Principles

### Guiding Principles

Our design process is guided by the following principles:

- **User-Centered Design**: Prioritizing user needs and preferences.
- **Consistency**: Maintaining a consistent look and feel throughout the application.
- **Simplicity**: Keeping the interface simple and uncluttered.
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring the application is usable by people with diverse abilities.

### Brand Guidelines

- **Colors**: Primary: #FFFFFF, #000000, #651FFF. Secondary: #F5F5F5, #FF4081.
- **Typography**: Main font: 'Roboto', serif. Accent font: 'Adamina', serif.
- **Logos and Icons**: [Link to brand assets]

## User Research

### Methods

We conducted user interviews, surveys, and usability tests to understand user needs and pain points.

### Findings

Key insights include the need for simplified navigation, clear feedback mechanisms, and a mobile-friendly interface.

## User Personas

### Persona 1: Alice Johnson

- **Age**: 34
- **Occupation**: Supply Chain Manager at a mid-sized manufacturing company
- **Needs and Goals**:
  - Efficiently manage and track invoices.
  - Ensure compliance with industry standards.
  - Simplify the invoicing process to save time.

### Persona 2: Bob Martinez

- **Age**: 42
- **Occupation**: Owner of a small logistics company
- **Needs and Goals**:
  - Reduce manual errors in invoicing.
  - Automate invoice validation and sending.
  - Ensure data security and integrity.

### Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Alice needs to create an invoice from a PDF

Alice receives a PDF invoice from a supplier and needs to convert it to a UBL XML format. She uses the application to upload the PDF, which then extracts the necessary data and generates a compliant UBL XML invoice. She reviews the generated invoice for accuracy and saves it for further processing.

#### Scenario 2: Bob wants to validate and send an invoice

Bob has created several invoices that need to be validated according to Australian rules before sending them to clients. He uploads the invoices to the application, which checks for compliance and generates validation reports. Bob reviews the reports, corrects any issues, and uses the application to send the validated invoices via email.
